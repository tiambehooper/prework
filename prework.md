# Prework

## Introduction

This prework should be completed before class starts. You can do it over a weekend, or you can spread it out over a longer period of time if you prefer. Please don't rush yourself. Its purpose is to arm you with basic knowledge that you can leverage early on in class. Students who complete the prework have a much higher rate of success in class.

The last section mentions a few things I'd like you to email me.

## Typing

Programmers type all day. As such, the ability to type quickly and accurately is very important. It is recommended that you take a [typing speed test](http://thetypingcat.com/typing-speed-test/1m). A good speed to target is 25 to 30 words per minute, or faster. If you fall short, a good place to practice typing is [typing.io](https://typing.io/). 

From the typing.io page:

> Typing.io is a typing tutor/trainer for programmers. Typing.io's lessons allow you to practice typing the key sequences that appear in real code.

## Mac Tutorials

Many students are new to Macs. If you've never used one before, it is recommended that you spend time familiarizing yourself with it before class. Apple provides a set of [getting started tutorials](https://support.apple.com/explore/new-to-mac) for new Mac users. Read through these tutorials and play with your new Mac. Being comfortable with your computer will make the first days in class that much easier.

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The focus of this class is learning how to build backends for web applications. The backend of a web application is the code that implements business logic and provides data to the frontend. The frontend is what users see and interact with. The backend of an application is invisible to users.

Even though this class doesn't _focus_ on the frontend, it's very important to have at least a working knowledge of these tools. You have a few options in this area:

### Front End Engineering Foundational Part Time Class

[The Iron Yard Foundational courses](https://www.theironyard.com/courses/front-end-foundations) are intended to teach the fundamentals of Web Development for people interested in learning more about tech. The Front-End Web Development Foundational course will enable you to build a functioning interactive website as well as develop a fundamental understanding of how websites are built and work. The course is part-time and will consist of seven evening classes over the course of two weeks. 

The foundational class costs $900 and requires students to provide their own laptops, but it comes with a $900 discount on our 12-week course. In other words, it's effectively free!

### Intro To Front End Engineering Online Class

If you can't attend a foundational class in person, The Iron Yard also offers a self paced online Intro To Front End Engineering class. This is a 30 hour class made up of 53 interactive lessons. This class costs $80.

Please note that this is an Early Access class. These are meant to give students a chance to be a part of the feedback process as we finish this course and its materials. 

### Codeacademy

Another good option to introduce you to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is Codeacademy. Codeacademy, which is not affiliated with The Iron Yard, offers interactive, online courses on a range of programming topics. The introductory portions of the courses are offered for free.

You should work though the free portions of these courses on Codeacademy:

* [HTML and CSS](https://www.codeacademy.com/learn/web)
* [JavaScript](https://www.codeacademy.com/learn/javascript)

It is recommended that you also try out their [JQuery course](https://www.codeacademy.com/learn/jquery).

## Java

Java will be the main language we work in this class. While we will be spending most of our time on Java, it is still useful to have had some exposure to it before class. The students who have written more code, tend to do better in class. 

Please start by working through The Iron Yard's online [Java Mini Course](https://newline.theironyard.com/paths/549). This class provides a quick introduction to Java. 

Next, work through the free portions of the [Codeacademy course on Java](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-java). This will give you a good foundation for day one of class. In particular, pay attention to:

* Basic data types
* Variables
* Operators
* If/else blocks
* Classes
* ArrayLists and HashMaps

In addition to the Codeacademy course, I _strongly_ recommend getting and reading [Head First Java](https://smile.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208?sa-no-redirect=1). Take time to work through  the first few chapters (at least). The book itself is a bit dated, but the material is still accurate, relevant, and useful. The way the book is written is very interactive and nonthreatening.

## Git

Git is a critical tool used by programmers to manage changes to their source code. Familiarity with it is going to be a requirement anywhere you end up working. Its purpose is to store "snapshots" (called commits) of your code, so you can see your progress and revert your changes if necessary. It also makes it easy to push your changes to a server, which acts as a backup of your code and a way to share and collaborate with other programmers.

Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account. Github is the most popular Git host, and the one we'll be using throughout the class. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name. Next, work through [Try Github](https://try.github.io/), a short course on how to use Git.

After that, read the following sections of the free online [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2):

* [Chapters 1.1 - 1.4](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
	* About Version Control
	* A Short History of Git
	* Git Basics
	* The Command Line
* [Chapter 2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) - Git Basics
* [Skim Chapter 5](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows) - Distributed Git

## The Command Line

We will be using the command line throughout this class. Yes, seriously. No, this is not the 1980s. Believe it or not, the command line provides a range of tools that help programmers be more productive. Anywhere you work, you will need to be at least moderately proficient with the command line.

You should work through the first two units in the [Codeacademy course on the command line](https://www.codeacademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

## Deliverables

When you've finished the prework, please email me at  doug@theironyard.com. In your email please share your Github username and tell me about your experience working through the prework. In particular, I'd like to know which programs you chose to work through. What was easy for you? What was hard? Based on the prework, what difficulties do you anticipate in class?

## After Prework, Before Class

If you finish all of the above and still have time, I'd like for you to start building your programming muscles. In martial arts there is the concept of a _kata_. A kata is a repetitive exercise that it done repeatedly to help form muscle memory. In programming, a kata is a small exercise that asks you solve a small problem.

Katas will help you begin to think like a programmer. They force you to break a problem into small steps and then write code to complete each step.

I recommend visiting [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/java). CodingBat provides katas that range from very simple to quite challenging. Start simple and do as many as you can before class. I recommend trying to do at least a few each day. 

If you run into problems, CodingBat provides links to helpful resources. Additionally, you can email me and, time permitting, I'll try to help you.
